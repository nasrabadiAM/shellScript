Many programs use external configuration files. Use of external configuration files prevents a user from making changes to a script. Config file is added with the help of source command.

If a script is shared in many users and every user need a different configuration file, then instead of changing the script each time simply include the config files.

Example:

We have two files, one is parent file (main.sh) and other is configuration file (config.sh). We have to source this configuration file into our parent file.
